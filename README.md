# Redilog
Redilog is a tool (as a Fabric mod) for converting a heavily simplified form of [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog) into redstone circuits. 

## Installation
Currently the only option is to build from source using `gradlew build` and the mod will be in `build/libs`.

## Usage
To start, designate a build space by putting layout markers at the corners and clicking on them to connect markers on the same x, y, or z coordinate. Then, place a builder adjacent to one of the markers, and click the builder to input some "redilog."
